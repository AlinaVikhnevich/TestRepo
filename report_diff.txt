Differences between test_best_visual.Rmd and best_visual.Rmd
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Added CSS hooks for external playback buttons (unused now) while keeping original fonts, background, and layout intact.
- Introduced Plotly-native Play/Pause controls (updatemenus) for each visual so sliders and buttons work together without custom JavaScript.
- Switched all three visuals to frame-based animation; sliders now call method = "animate" and figures carry plotly frames directly.
- Kept the choropleth geometry fixed per baseline while frames update only life expectancy/customdata values; playback runs faster (160 ms frames).
