Differences between test_best_visual.Rmd and best_visual.Rmd
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Restored frame-driven Plotly animations for the map, income bar chart, and continent line chart while keeping the styling from best_visual.Rmd.
- Each visual now defines frames, animate-driven slider steps, and Play/Pause updatemenus with durations tailored per chart (~140 ms map, ~260 ms income bars, ~320 ms continent lines).
- Removed the previous onRender JavaScript timers; interactivity relies solely on Plotly frames and built-in animation controls.
- Play/Pause button menus remain centered above each slider (per the provided reference placement) while keeping the original styling.
