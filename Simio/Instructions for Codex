Task for Codex: Create Version-Accurate Simio Navigation Guide

Context
I have uploaded a complete set of screenshots documenting my Simio environment into the folder:

/simio


in my testrepo.
These screenshots include every ribbon tab, ribbon group, window list, option panel, library list, dialogs, and definitions exactly as they appear in my installation.

Your role is not to rely on prior Simio knowledge, tutorials, or assumptions. You must treat the screenshots as the only source of truth.

Objective

Create a detailed documentation file named:

Simio Navigation


This file will serve as the authoritative navigation and UI reference for upcoming Simio projects.

Required Behavior (Strict)

Screenshot-driven only

Base all explanations exclusively on what is visible in the screenshots.

Do not introduce features, buttons, menus, or workflows that are not explicitly shown.

No assumptions

If a feature is not visible, do not infer its existence.

If a control is disabled, hidden, or context-dependent, explicitly state that.

Exact naming

Use the exact labels, capitalization, and terminology as shown in the UI.

Do not paraphrase ribbon names, group titles, or option labels.

Version fidelity

Treat this layout as version-locked.

Do not generalize to “Simio usually does X” or “in other versions.”

File Structure Requirements

The Simio Navigation file must be organized as follows:

Environment Overview

Simio version (if visible)

License type indicators (if visible)

General UI layout description

Ribbon Navigation

One section per ribbon tab

For each tab:

Tab name

Ribbon groups

Buttons and controls within each group

Notes on disabled or conditional items

Panels and Windows

Definitions window

Properties panel

Libraries panel

Any docked or floating windows

What each panel is used for, based only on visible context

Libraries

List all visible libraries

Objects contained in each library (as visible)

No speculation about hidden or unavailable libraries

Dialogs and Menus

Context menus

Dropdowns

Modal dialogs

What triggers each one, if visible

Navigation Rules

What actions are clearly possible

What actions are clearly not available

UI constraints imposed by this layout

Explicit Non-Goals (Do NOT do these)

Do not explain modeling theory

Do not suggest workflows

Do not provide “how-to” modeling steps

Do not reference external documentation

Do not include screenshots in the output file

This file is navigation and UI reference only, not a tutorial.

Output Requirements

Single file named Simio Navigation

Written clearly, technically, and precisely

Neutral, factual tone

No speculative language

Validation Rule

If you are unsure about a UI element:

State explicitly that it is unclear

Cite the screenshot filename where the ambiguity appears

Do not resolve ambiguity on your own

This document will be used as the foundation for all future Simio guidance. Accuracy is more important than completeness.
