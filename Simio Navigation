Environment Overview
- Simio version: Unclear. The version information is only present within the provided screenshots/PDF/Word images, which are not viewable in this text-only environment (e.g., Simio/Student version of Simio Screenshots.pdf; simio_doc/word/media/image1.png through image49.png).
- License type indicators: Unclear for the same reason; any license markers would be embedded in the unviewed screenshots.
- General UI layout description: Unclear. The overall layout depends on the visual content of the screenshots, which cannot be inspected here.

Ribbon Navigation
- Tab names, ribbon groups, buttons, and control states are all unclear because they are only visible within the screenshots (Simio/Student version of Simio Screenshots.pdf and extracted simio_doc/word/media/image1.png–image49.png), which cannot be read in this environment.

Panels and Windows
- Definitions window: Unclear; location and contents require visual review of the screenshots.
- Properties panel: Unclear; location and contents require visual review of the screenshots.
- Libraries panel: Unclear; location and contents require visual review of the screenshots.
- Docked or floating windows: Unclear; any such windows would have to be identified visually in the screenshots.

Libraries
- Visible libraries and contained objects are unclear because they rely on the screenshot visuals (Simio/Student version of Simio Screenshots.pdf; simio_doc/word/media/image1.png–image49.png).

Dialogs and Menus
- Context menus, dropdowns, modal dialogs, and their triggers are unclear; identifying them requires inspecting the screenshots.

Navigation Rules
- Actions that are possible or unavailable and UI constraints cannot be determined without viewing the screenshots.

Notes on Ambiguity
- All requested UI details remain unresolved because the screenshots (Simio/Student version of Simio Screenshots.pdf and the extracted simio_doc/word/media/image1.png–image49.png) cannot be interpreted in this text-only environment. Visual review is required to populate these sections accurately.
